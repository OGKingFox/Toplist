# Toplist
A gaming oriented toplist built using Phalcon PHP Framework. Some features include a chart for each server displaying incomming votes for every day of the month, Discord OAuth for login, discord widgets, and more. 

**This is v1 of the toplist and is no longer the main website. If you still wish to use this you can, but this will not be maintained. v2 (the current website) is currently not open source but i hope to open-source it soon. **

Required:
Phalcon PHP Framework - https://phalconphp.com/en/

##### DISCLAIMER: You will need a decent understanding of Phalcon and PHP to get this working. This is not something you will get set up in 5 mintues if you're new to Phalcon or PHP. I am not your personal teacher. If you already know Phalcon and just having issues i'll help, otherwise go read the phalcon docs and learn.

Setup:
- Upload to server or localhost
- Edit config to your desired settings.
- done.
